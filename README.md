# Art by Location

A simple webpage to practice React and working with APIs. Allows you to choose a location and then displays a random piece of artwork from the Metropolitan Museum of Art collection coming from that location. 

## Getting Started (WIP)

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment
for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites (WIP) 

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [Example 1](https://www.example.com)
- [Example 2](https://www.example.com)

### Installing (WIP) 

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development
environment running

Say what the step will be

    Give the example

And repeat

    until finished

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it
for a little demo

## Next Steps 

- Always room for refactoring...
  - Refactor Menu.js 
- Actually make it look nice 
- Prevent repeated button clicks while initial process is still loading 
- Replace with an API that actually lets me set the parameters I want
